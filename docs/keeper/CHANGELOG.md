# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Correct the Provider Host machine-key security-descriptor binding, validate
  the exact non-exportable CNG identity and protected owner/DACL policy, and
  reconcile an exact interrupted key without deleting or recreating it.
- Replace the default Keeper desktop with a PySide6/Qt Quick executive control center using the official lighthouse identity, 13 source-backed product areas, durable Keeper Assistant conversation, responsive layouts, and protected-path-redacted service health.
- Add a pinned standalone Windows build plus hashed per-user install, repair, upgrade, one-generation rollback, status, and data-preserving uninstall lifecycle.
- Require an authenticated Executive commit receipt before KeeperAuthority can bind
  typed reviewer input. The receipt proves the exact delivered-input record,
  reviewer attempt, session slot, usage reservation, and RESERVED launch claim were
  committed and conservatively launch-claimed before external execution; Authority
  protocol 6 carries this binding.

## 0.6.0

- Authorize restore against an integrity-checked immutable SQLite backup artifact,
  including WAL-backed source state captured at backup time, and bind the signed
  request to its artifact path and hash, backup operation ID, and source generation.
- Preserve consumed one-time approvals, consumption bindings and timestamps, crossed
  budget reservations, and related Executive attempt bindings monotonically when an
  older backup is restored; ambiguous bindings fail closed and preserved identities
  are recorded in the durable reconciliation evidence.
- Add a signed, bounded, project-scoped KeeperAuthority reconciliation fence. Covered
  attempt and launch-authority mutations are blocked until compare-and-confirm and
  live replacement complete; expiry and interruption require explicit conservative
  recovery. Executive schema 10, Authority schema 5, and Authority protocol 5 carry
  the new maintenance and fence state.

## 0.5.9

- Replace restore confirmation and reconciliation callbacks with exact typed
  production Founder authorization and a signed KeeperAuthority project-scope
  snapshot bound to the operation, backup, database identities, and generation.
- Preserve newer Authority terminal truth as non-retry-safe uncertainty, validate
  one-time approval consumption and budget reservations, and record the validated
  receipt before setting the reconciliation timestamp.
- Enforce restore exclusivity with a bounded OS shared/exclusive lock, durable SQLite
  maintenance state, write generations, final identity rechecks, and conservative
  interrupted-lease recovery.

## 0.5.8

- Adopt the versioned Keeper 1.0 single-Founder personal-use threat model for
  Completion Pass A and move same-process post-compromise scenarios to the
  hardening backlog.
- Make SQLite the only live Executive commit boundary and retire the external
  per-transaction lineage append.
- Add atomic integrity-checked backups, explicit Founder-approved restore with
  Authority reconciliation, and an in-database recovery epoch.

## 0.5.7

- Create Windows provider processes suspended and assign them to a configured
  kill-on-close Job Object before resuming the primary thread.
- Restrict inherited handles to the explicit standard streams and retain the
  process, primary-thread, Job, executable, script, and authority handles through
  descendant termination.
- Publish first-installation authority keys through a flushed same-directory
  temporary file and atomic no-overwrite hard link, loading a concurrent winner.
- Add pre-assignment, failure-cleanup, nested-descendant, cancellation,
  authority-access, and concurrent key-initialization regressions.

## 0.5.6

- Authenticate qualification and completion authority with installation-local
  HMAC-SHA-256 writer proofs and constant-time verification.
- Protect the Windows authority key with DPAPI, keep it outside provider evidence
  and repository roots, and fail closed when key loading is unavailable.
- Replace standalone raw qualification evidence with a protected evidence
  reference resolved from Keeper storage.
- Bind signed qualification and completion records to unpredictable pre-launch
  challenges and add forgery, wrong-key, cross-installation, and replay coverage.

## 0.5.5

- Separate provider registration from protected qualification; version metadata
  now comes only from an authorized retained-component qualification launch and
  immutable qualification evidence.
- Preserve registered capability and role restrictions through diagnostics,
  selection, routing evidence, and reports.
- Require an immutable Keeper completion journal before recovery can accept
  mutable provider evidence as terminal.
- Align standalone batch startup with qualified launcher/script composite
  registrations.

## 0.5.4

- Resolve recovery evidence only from the protected canonical `run.json` path
  and require complete execution identity plus an explicit provider status.
- Canonically digest the complete schema-versioned provider registration,
  including qualification and authorization metadata.
- Align standalone command startup with the current registration schema and
  exact invocation binding used by desktop routing.

## 0.5.3

- Require protected, pre-existing provider registration before command-provider
  discovery can report a provider as available.
- Preserve authoritative Windows launcher and batch-script component identities
  through adapter construction and launch evidence.
- Treat every unresolved durable execution-started attempt as indeterminate and
  non-retry-safe when provider evidence is missing, malformed, duplicated, or
  inconsistent.

## 0.5.2

- Added post-validation Windows replacement and junction-retarget integration
  coverage at the process-creation boundary.
- Retained registered batch scripts against replacement in addition to their
  immutable command launcher.
- Added spawned-process reroute races, committed-reservation crash recovery,
  execution-start crash recovery, and transactional rollback coverage.
- Persisted reroute reservation state in recovery and final-report evidence.

## 0.5.1

- Made recovery process discovery tri-state and fail closed on access denial and
  other indeterminate operating-system results.
- Bound command launch to mandatory immutable registration using retained
  deny-write/delete handles on Windows and post-launch image verification.
- Separated routing dispositions from actual provider execution attempts and
  reconciled reports against provider run evidence.
- Added atomic SQLite reroute consumption and destination-attempt reservation.

## 0.5.0

- Exercised controlled command executables through the complete author, independent
  review, repair, post-repair review, semantic verification, and evidence workflow.
- Added durable provider ownership checkpoints, incremental redacted logs, and
  retained-handle restart recovery that blocks ambiguous descendants.
- Added same-run selected-stage retries with stage-attempt identities, explicit
  authorization records, stable provider registration digests, truthful fresh
  instance identities, downstream invalidation, and irreversible-stage rejection.
- Added active waiver revocation and structured desktop evidence views for routing,
  provider identities, commands, verification, findings, logs, hashes, and Git results.
- Added rendered Windows Tk validation that navigates the real notebook, invokes the
  dashboard Refresh callback, verifies its status update, and records structured
  smoke evidence.

## 0.4.0

- Routed automatic and provider-specific desktop policies through discovered command
  and local-model adapters with independent review selection.
- Added startup interruption classification, immutable explicit retry attempts, and
  irreversible-stage retry rejection.
- Connected exact-scoped commit and push authority to durable lifecycle stages.
- Persisted live evidence roots, semantic command records, waiver details, Git
  results, retry history, and lifecycle notifications.
- Added a packaged rendered-Tk diagnostic mode with explicit unavailable reporting.

## 0.3.0

- Connected desktop tasks to the production orchestrator and durable lifecycle.
- Added approval/rejection, pause/resume, cancellation, live status polling,
  evidence actions, interactive setup, and lifecycle notifications.
- Added semantic command evidence, scoped waivers, and exact Git authorization.
- Added unified acceptance pilots and adversarial authorization coverage.

## 0.2.0

- Added versioned SQLite storage, migrations, backup/export, and legacy evidence import.
- Added full durable lifecycle, semantic verification binding, and tamper-evident reports.
- Added provider discovery, command adapters, deterministic independence routing, and
  loopback-only Ollama support.
- Added local desktop UI, first-run diagnostics, project/task/authorization workflows,
  notifications, history, and deterministic demonstration.
- Added dedicated Git safety, security controls, Windows packaging, documentation,
  and productization test coverage.
