# Known Limitations

- Windows is the packaged and smoke-tested target; the standard-library code is
  portable, but macOS/Linux bundles are not produced.
- Authenticated Codex execution and Claude Code execution were not exercised during
  productization; their adapters are implemented but explicitly classified as such.
- OS toast delivery is best-effort; every notification is retained in-app.
- Discord remains a future notification-only adapter.
- Keeper does not automatically delete retained logs or evidence.
- The desktop provides structured textual evidence drill-down rather than an embedded
  side-by-side diff renderer.
- Authenticated external command-provider task execution remains unverified. Controlled
  executables exercise the complete production adapter and workflow path without
  external credentials.
- Startup recovery terminates attributable orphan process trees and requires an
  explicit selected-stage retry. It resumes only from a durable verified checkpoint.
- Rendered Tk automation requires a Python runtime with matching Tcl/Tk libraries.
  The packaged diagnostic reports unavailable with exit 78 when that prerequisite is
  absent.
